# Book Library Project

## Description

This is a study project developed using Spring MVC. It is a small web application that allows you to register readers and books, assign books to people, and manage their returns.

The initial task was taken from a 2017 training course and used older versions of technologies, such as Java 1.8, Spring 5, Tomcat 9, and `javax` dependencies.

The project was created from scratch based on the course recommendations and thoroughly tested. Subsequently, it was refactored to use the latest versions of technologies, including Java 17, Spring 6, Tomcat 10, and others. Maven is used for project build and management. Spring Boot is not part of this project.
